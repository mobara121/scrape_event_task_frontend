# Introduction of this application

This PERN single page application shows events held in Indiana after April 15, 2021. Once the application is launched in your browser, a backend web scraping utility will fetch data for events from a public web page and create a local copy that is used to present the events to the user.  This backend of this application uses a combination of NodeJs with ExpressJs and postgreSQL for its relational database.  The frontend was created with ReactJs, which is declarative, efficient, and has a flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  Web scraping is performed by using a jQuery-like syntax with Cherrio which is a NodeJs library that helps to interpret and analyze the events web page: (https://www.visitindy.com/indianapolis-things-to-do-events)

### Backend Structure
The backend uses the MVC pattern where the components are described as follows:
- `app.js`\ - The entry point to server. All routers are imported and used here.
- `scrape.js`\ - The code performs the web scraping function. The scraped data was stored in both json and csv file.
- `controllers/eventcontroller.js`\ - The route callback functions. These functions convert requests into commands for the model and/or routes.
- `models/event.js`\ - The database query functions. These are functions that run parameterized queries based on arguments.

### Frontend Structure
- `src/app.js`\ - The parent component that fetches Api data that is used in every component. Also, search requests are sent to custom Apis from this component.
- `src/TableContent/TableContent.jsx`\ - The table component that renders custom Api data. Pagination is also operated by this component.
- `src/TableHead/Table Header.jsx`\ - The table header component that operates the sorting function.
- `src/Maps/Maps.jsx`\ - The component for rendering the Google Map. Latitude and longitude data is generated by fetching data from [Google's Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) to show a marker for each location by an onClick event handler that is triggered when a user clicks the map icon next to the event address.
