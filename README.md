# Introduction of this application

This PERN single page application shows the events to be held after April 15, 2021 in Indiana. To create this application, postgreSQL is used for database, backend is build on top of NodeJs with ExpressJs. Frontend is created on ReactJs, which is declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. For web scraping, I used Cherrio which is a NodeJs library that helps interpreting and analyzing of the web page (https://www.visitindy.com/indianapolis-things-to-do-events) by using a jQuery-like syntax.

## Technology stack

### Backend Structure
The backend uses the MVC pattern where the components are described as follows:
- `app.js`\ - The entry point to server. All routers are imported and used here.
- `scrape.js`\ - The codes performing web scraping. The scraped data was stored in both json and csv file.
- `controllers/eventcontroller.js`\ - The route callback functions. These functions convert requests into commands for the model and/or routes.
- `models/event.js`\ - The database query functions. These are functions that run parameterised queries based on arguments.

### Frontend Structure
- `src/app.js`\ - The parent component fetching Api data that is to be used in every other components. Also, searching requests are sent to the custom Api from this component.
- `src/TableContent/TableContent.jsx`\ - Table component rendering the custom Api data. Pagination is also operated on this component.
- `src/TableHead/Table Header.jsx`\ - Table header component operating sorting function.
- `src/Maps/Maps.jsx`\ -The component for rendering Google Map. Lattitude and longitude data generated by Geocoding Api shows a marker for each location by onClick event handler.
